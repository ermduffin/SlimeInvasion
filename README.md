# SlimeInvasion

Slime Invasion is a 2D platformer involving a rock golem who must protect his caves from a horde of slimes.

# Controls

The player can be moved left and right with the A and D or the left and right arrow keys, and jump with W, Spacebar, or the up arrow key. The player shoots rocks with the left mouse button.

# How To Play

Slime Invasion is made up of a series of endless rooms. The player must kill all of the slimes in the room they are in before proceeding to the next. There is a timer at the top of the screen representing the duration of time in which slimes can spawn. The number of slimes that spawn is dependent on the size of the level and a difficulty modifier which increases after each level is completed. Each slime appears from a random location out of a set of possible spawn locations, at a random point in time. There is a melee slime, and a variant which can use melee and ranged attacks. Once all of the slimes in a room are killed, the wall on the bottom right of the room will disappear and reveal a pathway to the next room. A potion will also appear which heals one of the playerâ€™s lives if collected. The goal of the game is to traverse as many levels and kill as many slimes as possible.
